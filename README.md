# Star-wars-game

This is a simple Star-Wars RPG game where you select a character and attempt to defeat the rest of the roster.

User picks a character from the roster. Once picked, the stats of that character will display.

Next, the user will pick another character to fight against. Once both characters have been selected, you can commence the fight. 

User wins once all opponents are defeated. User loses when their HP drops to 0. 


There is still room for improvement: implementing health bar as oppose to just numbers, balance out characters a little more, and maybe add some animation when characters are selected. Also work on styling the page.
